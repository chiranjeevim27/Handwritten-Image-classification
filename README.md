# MNIST Digit Recognition

This repository contains a simple neural network model built using Keras for recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

### Clone Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chiranjeevim27/Handwritten-Image-classification.git
```

### Data Preparation

The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing. It is loaded and preprocessed in the Jupyter notebook `Image-classification.ipynb`.

### Installation

Install the required Python packages. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of three layers: input layer, a hidden layer with 32 neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons (for each digit). Refer to the model summary in the Jupyter notebook for more details.

## Running the Model

Run the Jupyter notebook `Image-classification.ipynb` to load the data, preprocess it, build and train the model.
